Here is a clean, ready-to-paste GitHub README.md section for your repository containing 65 Python Pyramid Pattern Programs.
It includes:
✅ Title
✅ Description
✅ Features
✅ How to run
✅ Direct example code snippet
✅ Table of pattern types
(You can expand the table or I can generate full 65 programs if you want.)

🏗️ Python Pyramid Patterns — 65 Programs

A collection of 65 Python pyramid, triangle, and star-pattern programs ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced. This repository is perfect for students, interview preparation, and anyone wanting to strengthen logic-building and looping skills using Python.


---

📘 Overview

This repository contains 65 unique pattern programs written in Python.
Each pattern demonstrates the use of:

for loops

Nested loops

Logical control flow

Spacing & alignment

Number, star (*), and character-based patterns


The patterns gradually increase in complexity, starting from basic star pyramids to advanced symmetric, hollow, numeric, and alphabetic patterns.

⭐ Example Pattern (Direct Python Code)

1. Classic Star Pyramid

# Pattern 1: Classic Star Pyramid

rows = int(input("Enter number of rows: "))

for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print(" " * (rows - i) + "* " * i)

Output
